1. we need a pause button and a mute button.


2. no collision on trees and water fountains in level 1 and level 2.

3. no collision on ballon store on level 1 and level 2.

4. In level 2, if you get infected at the very beginning, there’s not enough time to stop by the first doctor’s office.

5. There appears a big bird cage in front of the doctor’s office every time I pass by in level 2.

6. We could have a simple animation of the soccer ball just by rotating it.

7.If the character pass by the doctor’s office and get pills, it’d be better to inform the players by popping up the pill icon.

8. When you about to dyhydrate, we need some instruction to show people that it’s time for time to click the pills if they have some. For instance, having a small hand pointing at the pill icon and move up and down would be good.

9. The background in all levels now is a static blue bg. I think that’d be better if we have a parallax scrolling background. For example, having some mountains or simple building outlines as the bottom layer, and making them moving slower than front layers.

10. In level 7, there is a black line beneath the waves.
