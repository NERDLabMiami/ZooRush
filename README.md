# Zoo Rush
Zoo Rush is a running adventure mobile game that seeks to raise awareness, destigmatize and create empathy for people with sickle cell disease. In the game, you take on the role of a zookeeper with sickle cell disease. It’s your first day on the job and all of the animals have escaped. Due to your condition you must avoid infections, hydrate often, check in with your physician, and take your medication to deal with chronic pain and potential crises. With your net in hand, it’s up to you to save the day.
